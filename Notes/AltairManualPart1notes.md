# Introduction
- Altair has 78 machine language instructions
- Part one of manual introduces the user to terminology and electronic logic
- part 2 and 3 speak about the computers actual organization and function

## A. Logic
- Boole showed how logical expressions can be analyzed with arithmetic relationships
- He published this work and much of its basis can be seen in computers
- His system of logic was called Boolean algebra
- It assumes that a logic statement can either be true or false (with no exception), this is similar to electronic circuits as they can be either on(true) or off (false). 
- A switch that is off can be seen as false but also a value of 0, a switch that is on can be seen as true and with a value of 1.
- we can create tables of this called truth tables

## B,
- We can combine the basic logic circuits
