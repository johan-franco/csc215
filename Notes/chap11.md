- ED FILE.TXT (creates a file and opens ED)
  - We can then use -V to turn off the automatic numbering
  - enter  'i' to enter input mode, which allows us to copy and paste
- CTRL I is tab
- The DEL, RUB, or RUBOUT key can be used to erase the last character entered.
- 3LT means you want ED to go down 3 Lines and Type one line
 - Substitute command can then be used to replace that line
  - Use S followed by the part that is incorrect. Then use CTRL Z and write the exact part you want it to be replaced by.
