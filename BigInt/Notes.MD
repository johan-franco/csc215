# General Notes
- Arbitraty-Precision integer:"indicates that calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are potentially limited only by the available memory of the host system." (wikipedia def)
- In the case study they decide on using class bigint for the values that are larger than what int can handle
- It will also be useful to construct a BigInt from a string value since a string can contain as many characters as needed to represent any BigInt value
- Requirements for their class
    -  be convenient and intuitive for programmers to use;
    -    be useful in a wide variety of applications;
    - mimic operations on C++ integers so that a program written and debugged using int values can be quickly and reliably converted to use BigInt values; and
    - utilize information hiding; it should be possible to use BigInt variables without knowledge of the underlying data structures or algorithms used
