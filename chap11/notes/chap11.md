# CHAP 11 NOTES

- ASL Programs should only be written in capital letters
- ED FILE.TXT (creates a file and opens ED)
  - We can then use -V to turn off the automatic numbering
  - enter  'i' to enter input mode, which allows us to copy and paste
- CTRL I is tab
- The DEL, RUB, or RUBOUT key can be used to erase the last character entered.
- 3LT means you want ED to go down 3 Lines and Type one line
 - Substitute command can then be used to replace that line
  - Use S followed by the part that is incorrect. Then use CTRL Z and write the exact part you want it to be replaced by. 
- B0P causes pointer to go to the begining of the program and lists out everything
- 0P lists out the page (?) and what it outputs will change depening on the pointer
-  When using the ASM command on a file it is doing the following:
    - Creating a symbol table
        - table has associated byte or address values
    - Assigned values are fetched out of the symbol table and placed in object code buffer
        - object code buffer is for its own internal use (we never see it)
- To actually create symbol table and to know what values to assign ASM goes through the program various times. 
- The option .AZZ is useful for troubleshooting as error messages are received earlier because the option says to disregard output
- ASM produces a .PRN file and a .HEX file
- .HEX is ideal for data transmission
- For the actual program to be executed the .HEX file has to be converted into the binary image of the program.  
- This is done using LOAD, after we do so we can simply call the file and it will run and show its output.
